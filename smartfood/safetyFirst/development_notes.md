You can definitely use **AWS Computer Vision** services (like Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels) to train a model that detects whether a worker is wearing the complete PPE set (helmets, gloves, masks, etc.) on a poultry line. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

---

### 🔹 1. Define the Problem Clearly

* **Goal:** Detect if a worker is wearing the full required PPE set (for example: gloves, steel mesh apron, goggles, mask, boots, hairnet).
* **Classes/Labels:**

  * `Helmet`, `Gloves`, `Goggles`, `Mask`, `Boots`, `Apron`, `Hairnet` (per individual item).
  * Optionally: `Full PPE` vs. `Incomplete PPE` as an overall status.

---

### 🔹 2. Collect and Annotate Training Data

* Capture **images/videos** of workers in the production line:

  * Wearing **all correct PPE**.
  * Wearing **partially correct PPE** (e.g., gloves missing, mask below nose).
  * **Incorrect PPE usage** (wrong type, visibly damaged, not worn).
* Use **bounding boxes** to annotate each item (gloves, apron, goggles, etc.).
* Tools: Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth or open-source tools like [LabelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg).

---

### 🔹 3. Choose AWS Service

* **Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels**: Best for object detection without building models from scratch.

  * Upload annotated dataset.
  * Rekognition trains a model to detect objects (PPE items) in images.

* **Alternative:** Use **Amazon SageMaker** with pre-trained models (e.g., YOLOv5/Detectron2) if you want more control. This requires ML expertise.

---

### 🔹 4. Training Process

1. Upload dataset to an **S3 bucket**.
2. In Rekognition Custom Labels:

   * Create a new project and dataset.
   * Import labeled images.
   * Train the model (AWS handles infrastructure).
3. Validate model with test set.

---

### 🔹 5. Inference / Real-time Monitoring

* Deploy the model as an **API endpoint** (Rekognition handles this).
* When an image (frame from CCTV or video stream) is sent:

  * Model outputs detected PPE items with confidence scores.
* Logic layer (your app):

  * If **all required PPE items are detected above confidence threshold**, mark as **Compliant**.
  * Otherwise, flag as **Non-compliant**.

---

### 🔹 6. Integration Ideas

* Connect to **CCTV / camera streams** → capture frames every X seconds.
* Use **AWS Lambda** to process images in near real-time.
* Store compliance logs in **DynamoDB** or **RDS** for audits.
* Trigger alerts via **SNS (SMS/Email)** if missing PPE is detected.

---

### 🔹 7. Best Practices

* Train with **diverse lighting conditions**, camera angles, and different worker body types.
* Keep retraining with new data (workers sometimes modify PPE use).
* Set different confidence thresholds per PPE type (small items like gloves are harder to detect than helmets).
