### **Project Brief: SmartLabel AI**

**Challenge:** Geekathon 2025 - "Smart Food Factories"
**Sponsors:** BRAINR & Grupo Lusiaves

---

#### **1. Executive Summary**
SmartLabel AI is a cloud-native, generative AI platform designed to automate the creation of legally compliant, multi-language, and market-specific food labels in real-time. The project directly addresses the significant compliance burdens and time delays faced by food manufacturers, particularly SMEs. Leveraging AWS Bedrock, SmartLabel AI generates everything from legal ingredient lists to channel-optimized marketing copy, reducing a multi-week process to minutes. Its key innovation is an instant crisis response generator, demonstrating a powerful, real-world application of GenAI that aligns with the hackathon's theme of "GenAI is not chatAI - beyond the obvious".

#### **2. Problem Statement**
Food companies, especially SMEs, are burdened by complex and fragmented food labeling regulations, a process that is slow and error-prone. This creates high costs, slows speed-to-market, and introduces significant compliance risks. During a food safety crisis, the manual process of updating labels and issuing communications is dangerously inefficient.

#### **3. Proposed Solution**
A generative AI tool that automates and accelerates label creation.
* **Core Functionality**: A user inputs raw product data, and the system generates a complete, multi-faceted label package tailored to specific markets.
* **Key Features for MVP**:
    * **Dynamic Regulatory Engine**: Switches between the distinct regulatory frameworks of Spain (EU), Angola, Macau, Brazil, and Halal standards.
    * **Certification Module**: Dynamically generates and applies certification marks like **Halal** and **International Food Standard (IFS)**.
    * **Product Customization Logic**: Adapts descriptions based on market-specific product variations.
* **Technology Stack**: AWS Bedrock (Claude), AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and a React frontend.

---

#### **4. Target Users & Markets**
The primary users are compliance, product, and marketing teams within food manufacturing companies.
* **Hackathon MVP Markets**: To showcase the platform's global capabilities, the MVP will target five strategic markets reflecting Lusiaves' export strategy:
    * **Spain** (Primary EU market)
    * **Angola** (Key African market)
    * **Macau** (Key Asian market)
    * **Brazil** (Key American market)
    * A **Middle Eastern** market (to demonstrate Halal compliance)

---

#### **5. Goals & Success Metrics (for Geekathon)**
The project's goals are directly mapped to the Geekathon's five evaluation criteria:
* **Functionality**: Successfully generate a complete label for all target markets in under 15 seconds during the live demo.
* **Technical Relevance**: Showcase a dynamic prompt engine that correctly applies distinct regulatory rules and certifications (e.g., Halal) on a scalable AWS architecture.
* **Innovation**: Demonstrate the unique "Crisis Response" feature live, generating a full communications package instantly.
* **Roadmap & Governance**: Provide a `README.md` with a clear roadmap to expand support to all 21 of Lusiaves' export markets.
* **Pitch Quality**: Clearly articulate the business value by contrasting the AI's speed (seconds) with the current manual process (weeks).

---

#### **6. MVP Scope (Hackathon Implementation Plan)**
* **IN SCOPE**:
    * A functional web UI for data input and label display.
    * A serverless backend on AWS generating labels for the five strategic markets.
    * A live demonstration of the "Crisis Response" feature.
    * A `README.md` file outlining the project and its future roadmap.
* **OUT OF SCOPE**:
    * User authentication.
    * Persistent storage or versioning of labels.
    * Direct integration with external MES/ERP systems.
