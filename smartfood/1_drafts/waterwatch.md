# WaterWatch - Smart Water Metering + Leak Early‑Warning

## Problem
Hidden leaks & overuse in washdown/CIP.

## MVP
* Simulated sub‑meter streams + anomaly detection on flow signatures
* Alerting and Pareto of top wastage zones

## KPIs
* m³ saved
* Response time
* Leak MTTR

## Implementation Notes
- Simulate water usage patterns for different zones
- Implement anomaly detection algorithms
- Create alerting system for unusual flow patterns
- Generate Pareto analysis of water waste sources
