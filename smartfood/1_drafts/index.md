# Smart Food Factories: The Future of Food Production Powered by AI
Grupo Lusiaves and BRAINR Challenge

## challenge

### Reimagine the Future of Factories with AI
Your team will have a full weekend to ideate, design, and build an AI-powered solution that tackles real challenges within industrial food production and processing environments. From optimizing operations to enhancing food safety, sustainability, and product quality, the possibilities are vast.
The final submission should be a functional online solution, ideally running in the cloud, that demonstrates how AI can transform food factories into smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable operations. There are no strict boundaries, as long as your project leverages AI in a meaningful way to address problems in the food industry.
We encourage bold thinking, creative use of data, and innovative applications that go beyond the obvious.
possible scopes & ideas

### Reimagine the Future of Factories with AI
- Food Quality Control: Detect defects, contamination, or non-compliance in food products in real-time.
- Energy Optimization: Monitor and reduce energy consumption across factory operations.
- Supply Chain Optimization: enhance inventory forecasting, reduce waste, and streamline logistics.
- Worker Safety & Efficiency: ensure compliance with safety protocols and improve ergonomics for workers.
- Waste Management: Create intelligent systems to monitor and reduce waste in processing, packaging, or by-products.
- Production Forecasting: Predict production needs and optimize resource allocation.
- Environmental Monitoring: Use AI for real-time tracking of emissions, air quality, or water usage.
- Predictive Maintenance: Predict when machines or equipment are likely to fail or need maintenance.


## prizes
The winner of this challenge will be selected by Grupo Lusiaves and BRAINR

### prize 1

### deliverables
The expected deliverables should follow the following format:
- Running Application: Submit your project in a public repository (e.g., GitHub), including a README file with:
A short description of the application.
The problem it addresses and your proposed solution.
Technologies and data used.
- Nice to Have(s):
  - A live, publicly accessible version of your application (e.g., hosted app, public API).
  - A 2-minute video demo or a step-by-step testing guide.
  - A clear roadmap or next steps for development (included in README).

Requirements: The project must address a real need or challenge within the scope of Smart Food Factories using AI technologies.
If the submission cannot be evaluated due to accessibility or missing information, teams will be contacted to resubmit before the deadline. Late resubmissions will be disqualified.


## evaluation criteria
All submitted projects will be evaluated by a panel of experts. The projects will be assessed based on the following:
- Functionality: Does the application work and solve the intended problem effectively?
- Technical Relevance: Demonstrates strong use of AI technologies (e.g., machine learning, computer vision, anomaly detection, etc.), robust architecture, scalability, and cloud deployment.
- Innovation: The uniqueness and creativity of the solution in addressing industrial challenges.
- Roadmap & Governance: Clear documentation of the solutio's roadmap and potential for future development.
- Pitch Quality: The clarity, structure, and persuasiveness of the demo/presentation.
