# OEE‑X - Root‑Cause Explorer with Explainability

## Problem
OEE dashboards don't explain *why*.

## MVP
* Ingest mock events: micro‑stops, changeovers, rejects
* Shapley‑style attributions to **loss buckets**; "if‑we‑fix‑this" scenarios

## KPIs
* Variance explained %
* Top‑3 actions → predicted OEE delta

## Demo Features
* Move a slider; see **forecast OEE** and **€ impact**
* Quick analytics app that can plug into BRAINR's data lake later

## Why It's Strong
* Quick to prototype
* BRAINR‑friendly analytics module
* "Explainability" sliders provide great demo
