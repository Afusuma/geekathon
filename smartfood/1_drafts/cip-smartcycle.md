# CIP SmartCycle - Clean‑in‑Place Optimizer

## Problem
CIP schedules waste water/chemicals and cause downtime.

## MVP
* CIP cycle templates + mock sensor curves (flow/cond/temperature)
* Rules + small regression to predict **cleanliness score** vs. cycle length
* Recommends **shortest safe cycle** and **shift placement** to minimize peak kWh

## KPIs
* Minutes saved/clean
* Water/chemicals saved (simulated)
* Downtime avoided

## Implementation Notes
- Create mock sensor data for different CIP cycles
- Develop regression model for cleanliness prediction
- Optimize for both cycle length and energy cost
- Build scheduling algorithm for shift placement
