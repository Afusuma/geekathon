# Metal‑Detector Challenge Log Digitizer

## Problem
Daily "test ball" checks are done on paper; intervals often missed.

## What it does
Digitize daily "test ball" checks; alert if intervals missed.

## MVP
Upload photo of paper log → OCR to table → check for required 3 tests/shift.

## Fake Data
6 photographed check sheets (some incomplete).

## Demo Moment
Missing 2 pm test triggers an alert + CAPA template.

## Stretch Goal
Add calendar view and SMS/email reminders.
