# MicroGuard - Predictive Micro Sampling & Risk Score

## Problem
Sampling is periodic, not risk‑based.

## MVP
* Combine mock features: room temp/humidity, previous positives, line utilization
* Risk model → dynamic sampling schedule + **COA** (certificate) generator

## KPIs
* Positives avoided (simulated)
* Samples per risk unit
* Lab cost avoided

## Implementation Notes
- Create risk scoring model based on environmental factors
- Implement dynamic sampling algorithm
- Generate certificates of analysis automatically
- Track sampling effectiveness over time
