# Supplier Passport - Data‑Driven Supplier Score & Onboarding

## Problem
Manual supplier vetting; slow onboarding.

## MVP

* Auto‑request documents, SLA dates, renewal reminders

## KPIs
* Days to qualify
* Missing doc count
* Risk‑weighted acceptance rate

## Implementation Notes
- Create supplier risk scoring algorithm
- Build automated document request system
- Implement SLA tracking and reminders
- Generate supplier qualification reports
