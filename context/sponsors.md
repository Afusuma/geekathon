# Two powerhouses unite for hackathon innovation

**BRAINR, a Portuguese food-tech startup that just secured €11 million in seed funding, and its parent company Lusiaves, Portugal's leading poultry producer managing 4,500 employees and €450 million in annual production, are joining forces to sponsor a hackathon.** This partnership combines Lusiaves' four decades of agri-food expertise with BRAINR's cutting-edge cloud technology, representing a unique convergence of traditional food manufacturing and digital innovation. The connection runs deep - BRAINR emerged as a spin-off from Lusiaves Group in 2021, with Paulo Gaspar serving as both BRAINR's CEO and Lusiaves' Chief Innovation Officer, bridging the two organizations' strategic visions.

## Lusiaves brings agricultural scale to the partnership

Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Figueira da Foz, Portugal, Grupo Lusiaves operates as the country's leading poultry company with complete vertical integration across the entire value chain. The company manages **20+ subsidiary companies across 36 production units**, producing over 100 million eggs, chicks, and chickens annually while processing 450,000 tons of feed yearly. Their brand portfolio includes Lusiaves, Campogrill, Margrill, Campoaves, Monge, and Petuga, with exports reaching four continents.

The company's leadership centers around the Gaspar family, with **Avelino Gaspar serving as President** and **Paulo Gaspar as Chief Innovation Officer and Vice-President**. Paulo brings exceptional credentials including an MSc in Entrepreneurship from Regent's University, studies in Exponential Technologies at Singularity University, and venture capital experience from Hoxton Ventures in London. This technology-forward leadership has driven Lusiaves' ambitious digital transformation, replacing 30+ legacy ERP systems with SAP S/4HANA and implementing Boomi integration platform to connect 145 applications with 115 integration scenarios processing 16,000 daily API calls.

Recent strategic moves demonstrate Lusiaves' international ambitions. The company became the **largest shareholder in Swedish poultry company Scandi Standard with 20.58% ownership** as of August 2025, with Paulo Gaspar elected as vice-chairman of the board in 2024. They're also participating in the EU's MICROORC project, a €7+ million Horizon Europe initiative running through 2025 focused on reducing food waste through microbiome technology. Despite their technological advancement, Lusiaves has not previously engaged directly with hackathon or developer communities, making this sponsorship through BRAINR particularly strategic.

## BRAINR delivers the tech innovation edge

BRAINR specializes in cloud-based Manufacturing Execution System (MES) solutions exclusively for the food industry, emerging from an urgent need to digitally transform food manufacturing operations within the Lusiaves ecosystem. The company currently **manages 25% of Portugal's total meat production** through its platform, overseeing €730 million in food production annually with plans to reach €1 billion by 2025. Their recent €11 million seed round led by C2 Capital Partners represents the largest global seed investment in food manufacturing digitalization to date.

The founding team combines deep industry and technology expertise. **Paulo Gaspar serves as CEO**, maintaining his dual role with Lusiaves while bringing his venture capital and startup experience. **Rui Batista as COO** contributes 20+ years of software development and ERP expertise, while **Ricardo Granada as CTO** adds 25+ years of software architecture experience. The 24-person team has achieved remarkable client success, including a 94% reduction in shipping errors for Campoaves and a 5x daily capacity increase for Avisabor without losing plant control.

BRAINR's technology stack represents cutting-edge food manufacturing innovation. Built on **AWS infrastructure with 99.999% uptime guarantee**, the platform processes 300,000+ operations daily through a cloud-native microservices architecture. The system features built-in AI capabilities for predictive insights, native integration with major ERP systems like SAP and Oracle, and comprehensive regulatory compliance tools for HACCP, IFS, FSMA, SQF, and BRC standards. Mobile-first design enables factory floor operations through dedicated tablet and smartphone applications, while IoT integration provides real-time production monitoring and predictive maintenance.

## Strategic priorities reveal complementary ambitions

Lusiaves pursues growth through vertical integration, international expansion via strategic acquisitions, and technology-driven operational excellence. Their participation in the EU MICROORC project demonstrates commitment to sustainability innovation, while their SAP S/4HANA implementation shows enterprise-scale digital transformation capabilities. The company's **99% automated production processes** at subsidiary Racentro exemplify their push toward Industry 4.0 manufacturing standards.

BRAINR's strategy focuses on rapid international expansion, targeting Spain, Germany, Holland, Scandinavia, US, and Brazil markets with plans to **hire 75 people by end of 2026**. They're preparing a €5-10 million funding round in 2025 for internationalization while expanding beyond meat processing into bakery, confectionery, and beverage sectors. The company positions itself as "building the digital brain for every food factory," making AI accessible across the food industry from the smallest plant to the largest operation.

## Developer community engagement shows contrasting approaches

BRAINR actively engages with the tech community, participating prominently in **Web Summit 2024** with dual booth presence and multiple pitch presentations. Paulo Gaspar competed in the "Road to START Summit" pitch competition where BRAINR placed as runner-up, earning personalized coaching from Armilar. The company maintains active presence at Portuguese startup ecosystem events and international food industry trade shows like Fruit Attraction in Madrid. They've won recognition from Manufacturing Tech Insights, StartUs Insights, and Food4Future, being named among EUROPA's 100 most promising European startups.

In contrast, Lusiaves shows no direct hackathon or developer community involvement despite their substantial technology investments. Their innovation focuses internally on enterprise systems, automation, and supply chain optimization rather than external developer engagement. This gap in their innovation strategy makes the BRAINR partnership particularly valuable, providing access to developer communities and startup ecosystems that complement their industrial expertise.

## Technology innovation priorities align for future growth

Both companies share overlapping technology priorities that strengthen their hackathon sponsorship rationale. Lusiaves brings expertise in **IoT integration across poultry facilities**, automated accounting and logistics processes, and large-scale data analytics for operational visibility. Their cloud migration journey and API-first integration strategy align perfectly with BRAINR's cloud-native architecture.

BRAINR contributes specialized food manufacturing software expertise, advanced AI and machine learning capabilities for predictive manufacturing, and proven ability to reduce waste and improve safety through digital transformation. Their focus on making enterprise-grade technology accessible to all food manufacturers, from smallest to largest, democratizes innovation across the industry. Together, they represent a powerful combination of agricultural domain expertise and cutting-edge technology innovation, positioning them uniquely to sponsor hackathons that bridge traditional food production with digital transformation.
