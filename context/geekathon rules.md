# Driving the Future of Sustainable Mobility Powered by AI
synvert xgeeks Challenge

## challenge
### Reimagine the Future of Sustainable Mobility with AI
Your team will have a full weekend to design and build an AI-powered solution, application, or tool that tackles challenges in sustainable mobility. The goal is to create solutions that address real-world Mobility issues and help shape the future of smart, connected cities.
The final submission should be a working online solution, running in the cloud. There are no "strict rules"â€”as long as your project makes meaningful use of AI technology. We encourage you to explore innovative ideas and think beyond the obvious.
possible scopes & ideas

### Reimagine the Future of Sustainable Mobility with AI
- Traffic Optimization: Predict and improve traffic flow in real-time to reduce congestion.
- Sustainable Mobility: Promote greener transportation options through data-driven insights.
- Public Transport Efficiency: Enhance scheduling, routing, and accessibility for public transit with AI.
- Data-Driven Mobility Insights: Analyze urban mobility data to support smarter city planning and decision-making.


## prizes
The winner of this challenge will be selected by synvert xgeeks
### prize 1
1x Apple Mac Mini per team member

## deliverables
The expected deliverables should follow the following format:
- Running Application: By submitting your project in a public repository, including a README file with relevant information:
    - A small description of the application.
    - The problem it addresses and the proposed solution.
- Nice to Have(s): 
  - Ideally, the application is available on a public endpoint (e.g., website to your app, public API endpoint, or other) with clear instructions on how to use and test the solution.
  - You can also add a 2-minute video demo of your solution or a step-by-step guide to test your solution (this will also help you to prepare the live demo if you are selected to present your solution on stage).

- 
Requirements: Any of the deliverables should address a need, a solution, or a problem under the scope of this edition of the event: "GenAI is not chatAI - beyond the obvious."

In the event of difficulty or failure to read the deliverable, the participants responsible for that project will be notified and are responsible for re-submitting before the challenge deadline. If the deadline has expired, the project concerned will be disqualified from the challenge.

## evaluation criteria
All submitted projects will be analyzed by an evaluation panel composed of team members of Synvert xgeeks. The panel will select the eligible projects based on the functionality of the running application. These projects will then be presented to the jury. The synvert xgeeks evaluation team will evaluate the projects based on the following criteria:
- Functionality: Does the presented application function as intended and "work"?
- Technical Relevance: Projects should demonstrate technical depth and relevance, making effective use of AI technologies, cloud infrastructure, data processing, scalability, and robust architecture to address mobility challenges.
- Innovation: Evaluate the level of innovation and uniqueness that the project brings to the current landscape.
- Roadmap and Governance: Projects should have a clear development roadmap, which should be added in the respective README files submitted by the teams.
- Pitch: The quality of the team's performance and submitted output.

# Smart Food Factories: The Future of Food Production Powered by AI
Grupo Lusiaves and BRAINR Challenge

## challenge

### Reimagine the Future of Factories with AI
Your team will have a full weekend to ideate, design, and build an AI-powered solution that tackles real challenges within industrial food production and processing environments. From optimizing operations to enhancing food safety, sustainability, and product quality, the possibilities are vast.
The final submission should be a functional online solution, ideally running in the cloud, that demonstrates how AI can transform food factories into smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable operations. There are no strict boundaries, as long as your project leverages AI in a meaningful way to address problems in the food industry.
We encourage bold thinking, creative use of data, and innovative applications that go beyond the obvious.
possible scopes & ideas

### Reimagine the Future of Factories with AI
- Food Quality Control: Detect defects, contamination, or non-compliance in food products in real-time.
- Energy Optimization: Monitor and reduce energy consumption across factory operations.
- Supply Chain Optimization: enhance inventory forecasting, reduce waste, and streamline logistics.
- Worker Safety & Efficiency: ensure compliance with safety protocols and improve ergonomics for workers.
- Waste Management: Create intelligent systems to monitor and reduce waste in processing, packaging, or by-products.
- Production Forecasting: Predict production needs and optimize resource allocation.
- Environmental Monitoring: Use AI for real-time tracking of emissions, air quality, or water usage.
- Predictive Maintenance: Predict when machines or equipment are likely to fail or need maintenance.

### prize 1
1x iPhone 16e 128Gb per team member

### deliverables
The expected deliverables should follow the following format:
- Running Application: Submit your project in a public repository (e.g., GitHub), including a README file with:
A short description of the application.
The problem it addresses and your proposed solution.
Technologies and data used.
- Nice to Have(s):
  - A live, publicly accessible version of your application (e.g., hosted app, public API).
  - A 2-minute video demo or a step-by-step testing guide.
  - A clear roadmap or next steps for development (included in README).

Requirements: The project must address a real need or challenge within the scope of Smart Food Factories using AI technologies.
If the submission cannot be evaluated due to accessibility or missing information, teams will be contacted to resubmit before the deadline. Late resubmissions will be disqualified.


## evaluation criteria
All submitted projects will be evaluated by a panel of experts. The projects will be assessed based on the following:
- Functionality: Does the application work and solve the intended problem effectively?
- Technical Relevance: Demonstrates strong use of AI technologies (e.g., machine learning, computer vision, anomaly detection, etc.), robust architecture, scalability, and cloud deployment.
- Innovation: The uniqueness and creativity of the solution in addressing industrial challenges.
- Roadmap & Governance: Clear documentation of the solutio's roadmap and potential for future development.
- Pitch Quality: The clarity, structure, and persuasiveness of the demo/presentation.
