# Story 2.1: Backend Expansion for Global Markets

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to expand the AI generation engine to support three new markets (Angola, Macau, and Brazil),

4. **AC4**: Portuguese translation is implemented for Brazilian and Angolan markets
5. **AC5**: Market-specific certifications and symbols are included where applicable
6. **AC6**: Updated data models support multi-market label variations
7. **AC7**: Database schema accommodates market-specific metadata

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Story 1.2 (Core AI Engine)** implemented the foundational `/generate` endpoint for EU/Spain market.
This story extends that functionality to support three additional global markets with region-specific requirements.

### Market Requirements Research
[Source: docs/prd/product-requirements-document-smartlabel-ai.md#functional-requirements]

**Target Markets for Global Expansion:**
- **FR2**: Support for Spain (EU), Angola, Macau, and Brazil
- **FR3**: Portuguese translation for Brazilian and Angolan markets
- **FR4**: Market-specific certifications (IFS and local standards)

**Market-Specific Context:**
- **Angola**: Former Portuguese colony, Portuguese language, developing food safety standards
- **Macau**: Chinese SAR with Portuguese heritage, dual language requirements
- **Brazil**: Large Portuguese-speaking market, ANVISA regulations, organic certification focus

### Enhanced Data Models
[Source: Story 1.2 and architecture/data-models]

**Extended Market Support:**
```typescript
export type Market = 'EU' | 'ES' | 'AO' | 'MO' | 'BR';
export type Language = 'en' | 'pt' | 'pt-BR';

export interface MarketSpecificData {
  certifications: string[];
  localRegulations: string[];
  culturalConsiderations: string[];
  languageVariant?: string;
}

export interface Label {
  labelId: string;
  productId?: string;
  market: Market;
  language: Language;
  labelData: LabelData;
  marketSpecificData: MarketSpecificData;
  translatedData?: LabelData; // For Portuguese markets
  createdAt: string;
  generatedBy: string;
}
```

### Market-Specific Prompt Strategy
**Prompt Template System:**
- Base template with market-specific sections
- Cultural and regulatory context injection
- Language-specific formatting requirements
- Local certification integration

**Market Contexts:**
- **EU/Spain**: Existing implementation, EU regulations
- **Angola**: Portuguese language, developing standards, tropical climate considerations
- **Macau**: Dual cultural influence (Chinese/Portuguese), tourism food service focus
- **Brazil**: ANVISA regulations, large-scale agriculture, organic certification emphasis

### Translation Requirements
[Source: FR3 - Portuguese translation requirement]
- **Target Languages**: Portuguese for Angola and Brazil
- **Implementation**: Bilingual label generation (English + Portuguese)
- **Variations**: Brazilian Portuguese vs European Portuguese differences
- **Quality**: Translation validation and cultural appropriateness

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Generate Handler**: `apps/api/src/handlers/generate.ts` (existing, to be extended)
- **Market Templates**: `apps/api/src/templates/markets/`
- **Translation Service**: `apps/api/src/services/translation.ts`
- **Market Types**: `packages/shared/types/markets.ts`
- **Market Schemas**: `packages/shared/schemas/markets.ts`

### Database Schema Extensions
[Source: architecture.md#database-schema]

**Enhanced LabelsTable:**
```yaml
LabelsTable:
  Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
  Properties:
    TableName: SmartLabel-Labels
    BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
    AttributeDefinitions:
      - { AttributeName: labelId, AttributeType: S }
      - { AttributeName: productId, AttributeType: S }
      - { AttributeName: market, AttributeType: S }
    KeySchema:
      - { AttributeName: labelId, KeyType: HASH }
    GlobalSecondaryIndexes:
      - IndexName: by-product
        KeySchema:
          - { AttributeName: productId, KeyType: HASH }
        Projection: { ProjectionType: ALL }
      - IndexName: by-market
        KeySchema:
          - { AttributeName: market, KeyType: HASH }
        Projection: { ProjectionType: ALL }
```

### Performance Requirements
[Source: NFR2 - 15-second response requirement]
- **All Markets**: Maintain sub-15-second response time
- **Translation Overhead**: Minimize impact of Portuguese translation
- **Prompt Complexity**: Optimize market-specific prompts for performance
- **Caching Strategy**: Consider market-specific caching patterns

### Tech Stack Requirements
