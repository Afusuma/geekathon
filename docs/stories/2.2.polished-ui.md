## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Story 1.3 (Functional UI)** established the basic UI foundation and workflow.
**Story 2.1 (Global Markets Backend)** provides the multi-market API capabilities.
This story enhances the UI with advanced features for showcasing global capabilities.

### UI Design Goals (Advanced Features)
[Source: docs/prd/product-requirements-document-smartlabel-ai.md#user-interface-design-goals]

**Advanced UI Elements for Epic 2:**
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Primary feature to showcase AI's global market intelligence
- **Compliance Scorecard**: Visual widget demonstrating regulatory compliance
- **AI Generation Trace**: Enhanced animation showing detailed generation process
- **Professional Polish**: Clean, fast, trustworthy tool for judge evaluation

**Design Principles:**
- **Visual Impact**: Immediately demonstrate the platform's global capabilities
- **Information Density**: Present complex information in digestible formats
- **Interactive Discovery**: Allow judges to explore features through interaction
- **Performance**: Maintain responsiveness despite increased complexity

### Enhanced State Management
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Zustand for state management]

**Zustand Store Structure:**
```typescript
interface AppState {
  // Market management
  selectedMarkets: Market[];
  primaryMarket: Market;
  comparisonMode: boolean;

  // Generation state
  generationProgress: GenerationStep[];
  isGenerating: boolean;

  // UI preferences
  language: Language;
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  complianceView: 'summary' | 'detailed';

  // Generated labels
  labels: Record<Market, Label | null>;
  complianceScores: Record<Market, ComplianceScore>;
}
```

### Component Architecture
**New Advanced Components:**
- `MarketSelector` - Multi-market selection with flags
- `SideBySideComparison` - Responsive comparison layout
- `ComplianceScorecard` - Interactive compliance visualization
- `GenerationTrace` - Enhanced animation component
- `LabelPreview` - Interactive label display
- `ExportDialog` - Multi-format export options

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Advanced Components**: `apps/web/src/components/advanced/`
- **Comparison Layout**: `apps/web/src/components/comparison/`
- **State Management**: `apps/web/src/stores/app-store.ts`
- **Export Utils**: `apps/web/src/utils/export.ts`
- **Animation Components**: `apps/web/src/components/animations/`

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **State Management**: Zustand (Latest) - Enhanced store structure
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components with custom extensions
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for advanced animations
- **PDF Generation**: react-pdf for export functionality
- **Print Styles**: CSS modules for print optimization

### API Integration Updates
[Source: Story 2.1 - Multi-market backend]
**Enhanced TanStack Query Integration:**
```typescript
// Multi-market generation
const generateLabels = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async (data: MultiMarketRequest) => {
    const requests = selectedMarkets.map(market =>
      generateForMarket({ ...data, market })
    );
    return Promise.all(requests);
  }
});

// Compliance scoring
const complianceQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['compliance', labels],
  queryFn: () => calculateCompliance(labels),
  enabled: !!labels
});
```

### Responsive Design Strategy
**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Stacked layout, swipe navigation
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Condensed side-by-side
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Full comparison layout
- **Large Desktop (> 1440px)**: Extended details panels

### Performance Considerations
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy load advanced components
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large comparison lists
- **Memoization**: Optimize re-renders in comparison view
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

### Accessibility Enhancements
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels for complex interactions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order for comparison views
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance for all visual elements
- **Focus Management**: Logical focus flow in multi-panel layouts

### Export and Sharing Features
**Export Formats:**
- **PDF**: Professional label documents
- **PNG/JPG**: Social media sharing
- **JSON**: Developer/API access
- **Print**: Optimized paper layouts

**Sharing Options:**
- **Direct Link**: Shareable URLs with generated labels
- **Email**: Built-in email composition
- **Social**: Pre-formatted social media posts
