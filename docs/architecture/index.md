# Fullstack Architecture Document: SmartLabel AI

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 17, 2025
**Author:** Winston, Architect üèóÔ∏è

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for SmartLabel AI, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project. The technical stack specifies a Turborepo Monorepo with React (`shadcn/ui`, Tailwind CSS) for the frontend and Node.js on AWS Lambda for the backend. The most effective approach is to initialize a `Turborepo` from scratch and configure it with two primary applications: `web` (a Next.js application) and `api` (a collection of serverless functions managed by AWS SAM).
