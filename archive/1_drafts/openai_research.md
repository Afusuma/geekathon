Awesome—thanks for sharing the background. Below are **new, hackathon‑ready project ideas** (beyond the 5 from your research) plus **exact MVP scopes, demo scripts, metrics, and a weekend build plan.** I also highlight **which one I’d pick** for the highest win probability and why.

---

## TL;DR — Pick This to Win

**🏆 Recommended build:** **LabelGuard AI – Allergen & Label Integrity Copilot**
**Why:** High business impact (recall prevention, compliance), clear “wow” demo (camera spots a wrong label in real time), easy to fake data, and clean integration story with BRAINR quality events. It also speaks directly to Avelino (risk, brand, jobs via safer processes) and Paulo (cloud, AI, MES integration).

**48‑hour MVP:** Webcam + OCR + simple CV model verifies SKU, allergens, date/lot codes vs. the digital spec; creates a **non‑conformance event** to a mock BRAINR endpoint and a **hold/stop‑line** suggestion in a small dashboard.

---

## 12 Fresh Project Ideas (each with MVP scope)

### 1) **LabelGuard AI (Allergen & Label Integrity Copilot)**

**Problem:** Mislabeling and allergen errors drive recalls; manual checks miss edge cases.
**MVP (weekend):**

* Webcam or sample images of packages.
* OCR (date/lot, ingredients) + rules engine that compares to a **digital product spec** (JSON).
* “Pass/Fail” overlay + **Non‑Conformance Event** POST to a mock `/events/nonconformance`.
* Dashboard: open non‑conformances, root‑cause tag, and printable hold ticket.
  **KPIs:** Mislabel detection rate, false positive rate, time‑to‑detect, #holds avoided (simulated).
  **Stretch:** Small on‑edge model to detect **label position skew** or **missing allergen icon**.

---

### 2) **YieldPilot (Vision‑Guided Cut Routing & Grade Optimization)**

**Problem:** Yield loss from mis‑graded cuts; operators can’t see global optimum.

## LabelGuard AI — Deep Dive (Build This)

### Problem → Business Case

* **Mislabel/allergen errors** = recalls, scrap, and brand risk.
* **Target outcome:** detect issues **before case sealing** and log digital proof.

### MVP Scope (what you can actually ship this weekend)

1. **Spec Store (JSON):** SKU, allergens, label text fragments/regex, lot/date rules.
2. **Vision & OCR:**

   * Image capture from webcam or folder.
   * OCR for text zones (ingredients, lot/date); optional CV to detect required icons.
3. **Rules Engine:** Compare OCR output to spec (e.g., “CONTAINS: SOY”), verify date code format (YYMMDD), lot prefix, language.
4. **Eventing:** On mismatch → create **Non‑Conformance** with severity, SKU, image snippet; POST to **mock MES endpoint**.
5. **Operator UI:**

   * Live camera feed with **Pass/Fail overlay**
   * Queue of open NCs, buttons: *Hold Pallet*, *Recheck*, *Override (reason)*
   * Export **Audit PDF** with images & timestamps.

### Data You Can Fake

* 10–20 label images across 3 SKUs (good + intentionally wrong).
* JSON specs with allergens, date/lot patterns.
* Operator actions log.

### Architecture (simple & realistic)

```
Camera/Images → OCR (date/lot/ingredients)
             → Icon Detector (optional)  
             → Rules Engine (Spec JSON)
             → Event Dispatcher → Mock MES (/events/nonconformance)
             → Dashboard (Streamlit/React) + SQLite/Postgres
```

### KPIs for Judges

* **Detection rate:** ≥ 95% of seeded mislabels caught (demo set).
* **False positives:** ≤ 5% on good labels.
* **Time‑to‑decision:** < 1s per pack on laptop webcam (demo).
* **Auditability:** PDF artifact with image crop + rule violated.

### Stretch Goals (if time remains)

* On‑edge inference (Raspberry Pi/Jetson) demo.
* **Active learning loop:** accept operator correction → auto‑augment training data.
* **Multi‑language packs:** regex & dictionary swap.

### Sponsor Hooks

* **BRAINR:** Treat NC as **Quality Control Event**; webhooks for *status\_changed* → close NC when operator verifies.
* **Lusiaves:** Poultry SKUs with allergen icons; ties to CSR (safety) and brand protection.

---

## “Mock Integration” Contract (safe for demo)

* `POST /v1/events/nonconformance`

  ```json
  {
    "factory_id": "VALADO-01",
    "line_id": "PACK-02",
    "sku": "CH-BON-500",
    "reason_code": "LBL_ALLERGEN_MISSING",
    "severity": "HIGH",
    "image_url": "s3://demo/frame_123.jpg",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-13T10:45:12Z"
  }
  ```
* `GET /v1/events?status=open&type=nonconformance`
* `POST /v1/events/{id}/actions` (e.g., `HOLD_PALLET`, `OVERRIDE` with reason)

*(Implement these as a tiny Flask/FastAPI mock or just stub the calls and persist to SQLite.)*

---

## Two More Strong Builds (brief)

**Demo:** Move a slider; see **forecast OEE** and **€ impact**.
**Hook:** Quick analytics app that can plug into BRAINR’s data lake later.

---

## Weekend Build Plan (no guesswork)

* 2–4h: Pitch deck + demo script + Judge Q\&A rehearsal.
* 4–6h: Record fallback demo video; lock everything.

---

## Demo Script (3–4 minutes)

1. **Hook (20s):** “In food, most recalls start with a label.”
2. **Live Run (90s):** Show good pack → green overlay; show wrong allergen icon → red overlay; dashboard auto‑opens NC with image.
3. **Operator Action (40s):** Click *Hold Pallet*, add note, show audit PDF.
4. **Business Impact (40s):** KPI slide: 95% detection on seeded cases; simulated € recall avoided per 10k packs.
5. **Integration (30s):** One slide: webhooks into BRAINR QC events.
6. **Vision (20s):** Edge device + multi‑line scale‑up.

## Slide Outline (10 slides max)

1. **Title & Team**
2. **Problem & Stakes (recalls, compliance, brand)**
3. **Today’s Process Gaps**
4. **LabelGuard AI (What it does)**
5. **Live Demo**
6. **Results & KPIs**
7. **How It Integrates (Mock BRAINR API)**
8. **ROI & ESG angle (safety, jobs via fewer disruptions)**
9. **Roadmap (pilot → scale)**
10. **Ask & Thank You**

---

## ROI Template (use conservative, transparent math)

* Assumptions: packs/day, baseline mislabel rate, cost per incident (scrap + rework + admin), probability‑weighted recall cost.
* Savings = (incidents avoided × per‑incident cost) + (rework time saved × labor rate) + (reduced line stops × throughput value).
* Show **low/base/high** scenarios; emphasize job safety & brand protection.

---

## Judge Q\&A Cheat‑Sheet

* **Data:** “We used synthetic label images and public fonts; specs live in JSON. Real plant rollout uses existing pack‑out cameras or a small edge cam.”
* **False Positives:** “Threshold tuning + operator ‘Override with Reason’ prevents nuisance stops; active learning reduces FPs over time.”
* **Scale:** “Stateless microservice + on‑edge cache; per‑line container; integrates via events, not invasive PLC changes.”
* **Jobs:** “Shifts operators from manual scanning to exception handling; faster, safer, more skilled work.”
* **Security:** “No consumer PII; image frames are non‑sensitive; signed URLs + retention policy.”

### My top 3 for fastest “wow per hour”

1. **DateCode Checker Lite (#1)** – dead simple, high impact, great demo.
2. **Changeover Stopwatch + Pareto (#6)** – classic, clean visuals, business value.
3. **Lot Linker Lite (#17)** – makes traceability tangible in minutes.

If you want, I can draft a **starter repo scaffold** (FastAPI + Streamlit + sample data + JSON specs) tailored to any 3 you choose so you can plug‑and‑play at the hackathon.
Absolutely—here’s a **clear, build‑ready breakdown** of **6) Changeover Stopwatch + Loss Pareto** with flows, data model, UI, math, and integration details so you can ship it in a weekend and demo it confidently.

---

## 1) What problem it solves (in one line)

**Changeovers steal hours** each week, but teams rarely know **which specific tasks** (cleaning, film swap, QA wait, tools, etc.) cause most of the loss. This app makes changeovers measurable and ranks the biggest time sinks so you fix the right ones first.

---

## 2) User flows (operator & supervisor)

**Operator (on a tablet at the line)**

1. Tap **Start Changeover** when the last good unit of SKU A is produced.
2. Pick **From SKU → To SKU** (or scan the work order/QR).
3. While work happens, tap one big **Reason button** at a time (e.g., *Cleaning*, *Label setup*, *Waiting for QA*).

   * Each tap **time‑slices** the ongoing changeover into segments by reason.
   * If they forget to switch, default the current segment to the last reason to avoid gaps.
4. Tap **End Changeover** when the first good unit of SKU B is produced.
5. Optional: add **notes**, attach 1 photo (e.g., damaged tool), or a **crew size**.

**Supervisor**

1. Open **Dashboard** → see **weekly Pareto** of changeover minutes by reason.
2. Click a bar to see **examples** (notes/photos) and **time stamps**.
3. Use the **What‑If slider** to simulate *“Reduce top reason by 30%”* → instantly see **minutes/week saved** and **€ impact**.
4. Export a **1‑page PDF** (Pareto + what‑if summary) for the daily meeting.

---

## 3) MVP scope (exactly what to build)

* **One screen timer** with:

  * `Start` / `End` (guarded by press‑and‑hold to avoid accidental taps).
  * **Reason selector** (large tiles). Switching reason = closing previous segment & opening a new one.
  * **Current elapsed time** (overall & current reason).
  * Optional fields: *crew size*, *notes*.

* **Reason set (curated, 8–10 max)**
  Keep it short so operators actually use it:

  * `CLN` Cleaning/Sanitation
  * `LBL` Label/film change & print setup
  * `MAT` Waiting on materials/components
  * `QA` Waiting on QA/quality release
  * `ENG` Tooling/engineering adjustment
  * `SET` Machine settings (speeds, temps)
  * `TRN` Operator instructions/training
  * `OTH` Other (requires note)

* **Data store:** SQLite (local) or a simple Postgres table.

* **Analytics page:**

  * Filter by **line / date range / SKU family**.
  * **Pareto chart** (minutes by reason, descending).
  * **Table** (count, avg segment, max segment).
  * **What‑If panel** (reduce top N reasons by X% → show minutes & € saved).

* **Exports:**

  * **CSV** of segments.
  * **PDF** of Pareto + what‑if (single page).

## 5) Pareto & What‑If math (so you can defend the ROI)

**Pareto (per filter window):**

* For each `reason_code`: `Total Minutes = sum(duration_sec)/60`.
* Sort descending → chart bars.

**What‑If scenario:**

* Choose top `k` reasons (default `k=1`) and a reduction factor `r` (e.g., 30%).
* **Minutes saved** `= TotalMinutes(top_k) × r`.
* **Availability gain** = `Minutes saved / Scheduled Production Minutes`.
* **Output gain (units)** = `Minutes saved × RunRate (units/min)`.
* **€ impact** = `Output gain × ContributionMargin per unit`.

**Worked example (check the arithmetic):**

* Weekly top reason (QA wait) = **124 min**
* Reduction target `r = 50%` → **62 min saved**
* Line run rate = **80 packs/min**
* Packs gained = `62 × 80 = 4,960`
* Margin per pack = **€0.07**
* **€/week** = `4,960 × 0.07 = €347.20`
* **€ / year** (×52) ≈ **€18,054.40**

Show this live with sliders and numbers that update instantly.

## 6) UI details (so it’s operator‑friendly)

**Timer Screen (mobile/tablet)**

* Top: Line & WO info (large text), elapsed changeover time.
* Middle: **Big reason tiles** (2 columns). Active reason is highlighted.
* Bottom: **Start / End** (hold to confirm), **Add note/photo**, **Crew size**.
* Idle protection: If no reason selected for >90s while running, flash “Select reason” and auto‑apply the last reason to avoid gaps.

**Dashboard**

* Filters row (date, line, SKU family).
* **Pareto bar chart** (click a bar to see examples & notes/photos).
* **KPIs cards:** total changeover minutes, avg changeover, count/week, % time in “waiting” vs “doing”.
* **What‑If panel:** `Top N` selector + `% reduction` slider → shows minutes, % availability, units, €.

## 7) Demo script (3–4 minutes)

1. **Start** a changeover (shows big stopwatch).
2. Tap **CLN → LBL → QA** to create 3 segments in 30–40 seconds.
3. **End** changeover; go to dashboard.
4. Pareto shows **QA wait** as #1 (seeded).
5. Move slider to **50% reduction** → “Save **62 min/week**, **€18k/year**.”
6. Export **PDF**; show it’s ready for the morning meeting.

*(Seed 15 historical events so the Pareto looks realistic on first load.)*

---

## 8) Tech stack (fast & dependable)

* **Backend:** FastAPI or Flask + SQLite (file), simple auth (PIN per line).
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (fastest) or React/Vite (nicer polish).
* **Charts:** Plotly or Chart.js.
* **Packaging:** Docker optional; not required for hackathon.
* **Offline:** Keep local cache; POST exports later if network drops.

## 9) “Stretch: Export to BRAINR format / webhook”

When a changeover ends, send **one “changeover” event** plus **child “loss” segments**.

**Changeover event**

```json
{
  "factory_id": "VALADO-01",
  "line_id": "PACK-02",
  "event_type": "CHANGEOVER",
  "from_sku": "CH-WNG-400",
  "to_sku": "CH-BON-500",
  "start_ts": "2025-09-13T08:02:10Z",
  "end_ts": "2025-09-13T08:26:10Z",
  "duration_sec": 1440,
  "crew_size": 3,
  "notes": "Allergen cleanup required"
}
```

**Loss segments**

```json
[
  {
    "parent_event_id": "CHG-001",
    "event_type": "LOSS_SEGMENT",
    "category": "CHANGEOVER",
    "reason_code": "CLN",
    "start_ts": "2025-09-13T08:02:10Z",
    "end_ts": "2025-09-13T08:18:50Z",
    "duration_sec": 1000
  },
  {
    "parent_event_id": "CHG-001",
    "event_type": "LOSS_SEGMENT",
    "category": "CHANGEOVER",
    "reason_code": "LBL",
    "start_ts": "2025-09-13T08:18:50Z",
    "end_ts": "2025-09-13T08:26:10Z",
    "duration_sec": 440
  }
]
```

*(If BRAINR expects a different schema at the hackathon, you can easily adapt the field names.)*

---

## 10) Seed data you can drop in (15 events)

* 5 changes with allergen cleanup (CLN heavier).
* 4 changes with label setup (LBL heavy).
* 3 with QA wait (QA heavy).
* 3 mixed.

Target distributions (example):

* CLN: \~40% of minutes
* LBL: \~25%
* QA: \~20%
* MAT/ENG/SET/OTH: remainder

This guarantees a **clean Pareto** out of the box.

---

## 11) Guardrails & edge cases

* **Accidental taps:** Use hold‑to‑start/stop and a **2‑tap reason switch**.
* **Forgot to switch reasons:** Auto‑extend last reason; allow quick edit in a post‑screen.
* **Too many reasons:** Cap at 8–10. Merge or hide rarely used ones.
* **Gaming:** Require note when selecting `OTH`; quick supervisor review of outliers.
* **Multi‑line site:** Dropdown to choose line; default to last used.

---

## 12) Why judges will like it

* **Instant insight:** A Pareto chart that clearly shows the biggest fix—no fluff.
* **Actionable what‑if:** Shows **minutes & euros** gained by targeting the top one or two causes.
* **Credible rollout:** Simple timers now → later integrate with MES/labels/sensors.
* **People‑positive:** Doesn’t replace jobs; it helps crews prove where they need support.

If you want, I can provide a **ready‑to‑paste reason code set**, a **seed CSV with 15 events**, and a **minimal FastAPI + Streamlit skeleton** so you can run the demo immediately.
