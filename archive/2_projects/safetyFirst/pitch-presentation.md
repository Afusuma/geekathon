## Slide Deck Structure (8 minutes total)

### Slide 1: Title & Team (30 seconds)
```
üõ°Ô∏è SafetyFirst AI
Intelligent Worker Protection & Performance

TEAM: [Your Names]
Smart Food Factories Hackathon 2025
Powered by BRAINR Integration
```

**Speaker Notes**: "4,500 Lusiaves workers deserve to go home safely every day. We built SafetyFirst AI to make that promise a reality using computer vision and artificial intelligence."

### Slide 2: The Problem (60 seconds)
```
üíî THE SAFETY CRISIS IN FOOD MANUFACTURING

‚Ä¢ 80% employee turnover rate in food industry
‚Ä¢ 30% higher accident rate than other manufacturing
‚Ä¢ ‚Ç¨150,000+ average cost per workplace accident
‚Ä¢ Manual safety checks miss 40% of violations
‚Ä¢ Regulatory compliance gaps cost millions in fines

At Lusiaves' scale (4,500 workers, 36 facilities):
‚Üí ‚Ç¨2.7M annual accident-related costs
‚Üí 1,440 preventable injuries per year
‚Üí Immeasurable human suffering
```

**Speaker Notes**: "Food manufacturing is one of the most dangerous industries. With Lusiaves' 4,500 employees across 36 facilities, even a 1% accident rate means 45 injured workers annually. We can do better."
