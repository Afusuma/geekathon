## **Product Requirements Document: SmartLabel AI**

---

### **1. Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**
* To develop a functional, cloud-deployed prototype that excels in all five of the Geekathon's evaluation categories: Functionality, Technical Relevance, Innovation, Roadmap, and Pitch Quality.
* To specifically showcase a dynamic regulatory engine for multiple international markets to impress the sponsors, BRAINR and Grupo Lusiaves.
* To demonstrate a unique "Crisis Response" feature as a key technical and business differentiator.

#### **Background Context**
This project addresses a critical pain point for food manufacturers like Grupo Lusiaves, who export to numerous countries with diverse and complex labeling laws. The current manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of ensuring compliance for each market creates significant operational friction and risk. SmartLabel AI aims to solve this by using Generative AI to produce compliant, market-specific labels in seconds, dramatically improving efficiency and speed-to-market.

### **2. Requirements**

#### **Functional**
1.  **FR1**: The system shall generate a multi-part food label (legal, marketing, compliance) from a single set of raw product data inputs.
2.  **FR2**: The system's core generation engine must support label creation for four distinct markets: Spain (EU), Angola, Macau, and Brazil.
3.  **FR3**: The system must generate labels in English and provide a Portuguese translation, as it is the required language for the Brazilian and Angolan markets.
4.  **FR4**: The system's output shall include the correct textual and symbolic representation of market-specific certifications, like International Food Standard (IFS), where applicable.
5.  **FR5**: The system must include a "Crisis Response" function that instantly generates a package of materials, including revised labels and public communications, based on a crisis input.
6.  **FR6**: The solution must have a simple web interface that allows for product data input and displays the generated label results for the demo.

#### **Non Functional**
1.  **NFR1**: The final application must be fully functional and running on a publicly accessible cloud endpoint (AWS).
2.  **NFR2**: Label generation should be completed in under 15 seconds from the time of request, accounting for a potential Lambda 'cold start'.
3.  **NFR3**: The complete source code must be available in a public repository with a `README.md` that contains, at a minimum, sections for: Problem, Solution, Local Setup Instructions, and a Future Roadmap.
4.  **NFR4**: The architecture must be serverless and inherently scalable to demonstrate technical relevance and readiness for growth.

### **3. User Interface Design Goals**
The UI vision is for a clean, fast, and trustworthy tool. The primary interaction is a cyclical "Input -> Generate -> Review -> Iterate" workflow. The key design elements are:
* **Default View**: A **"Side-by-Side Comparison"** to instantly showcase the AI's power by comparing the EU label with another market's.
* **Polished Widgets**: The UI will include a **"Compliance Scorecard"** and an **"AI Generation Trace"** animation to make the demo more impactful.
* **Error Handling**: The UI will gracefully handle backend errors with user-friendly messages.

---

### **4. Technical Assumptions**

* **Repository Structure**: A **Monorepo** managed by a tool like `Turborepo` to streamline development.
* **Service Architecture**: A **Managed Serverless** architecture using AWS SAM or the Serverless Framework to simplify development and deployment.
* **Testing**: A pragmatic testing pyramid including Unit, Integration, and **one critical-path End-to-End (E2E) test**.
* **Tech Stack**:
    * **Frontend**: React with `shadcn/ui` and `Tailwind CSS`.
    * **Language**: TypeScript across the entire stack.
    * **Backend**: Node.js on AWS Lambda.
    * **GenAI**: AWS Bedrock (Claude model).
    * **Database**: DynamoDB.

### **5. Epic List**

1.  **Epic 1: Core Label Generator MVP**
    * **Goal**: To build and deploy a functional, end-to-end application that can generate a compliant label for a single market (EU/Spain) and display it in a clean, simple UI.

2.  **Epic 2: Global Expansion, UI Polish & Crisis Mode**
    * **Goal**: To expand the application by adding the remaining global markets (Angola, Macau, Brazil), implementing the polished UI features (side-by-side view, scorecard, etc.), and integrating the high-impact "Crisis Response" feature.

### **6. Epic 1 Stories: Core Label Generator MVP**
*(This epic focuses on building a functional end-to-end application for a single market)*

* **Story 1.1: The "Steel Thread" - Infrastructure & Connectivity**
    * **As a** developer, **I want** a configured monorepo with a "hello-world" Lambda endpoint and a minimal React app that can successfully call it, **so that** the core end-to-end architecture is proven and de-risked.
* **Story 1.2: Core AI Generation Engine (Backend)**
    * **As a** developer, **I want** to implement the core AI generation logic within the Lambda function to produce a compliant label for the EU/Spain market, **so that** the primary value proposition of the application is functional.
* **Story 1.3: Functional UI Implementation**
    * **As a** hackathon judge, **I want** a functional interface to input data for the generator, including clear loading and error states, and view the results, **so that** I can interact with and validate the application's core feature.

---

### **7. Epic 2 Stories: Global Expansion, UI Polish & Crisis Mode**
*(This epic expands the stable application with advanced features and global support)*

* **Story 2.1: Backend Expansion for Global Markets**
    * **As a** developer, **I want** to expand the AI generation engine to support three new markets (Angola, Macau, and Brazil), **so that** our application demonstrates its global capabilities.
* **Story 2.2: Polished UI Implementation**
    * **As a** hackathon judge, **I want** to see the results for all markets in a polished and intuitive interface with advanced visualizations, **so that** I can easily understand the full power and intelligence of the platform.
* **Story 2.3: "Crisis Response" Feature Implementation**
    * **As a** user, **I want** a dedicated "Crisis Simulator" feature that can generate a complete communications package, **so that** I can respond to a food safety event instantly.
* **Story 2.4: Final Polish & Documentation**
    * **As a** developer, **I want** to add the final "AI Generation Trace" animation and complete the `README.md` file, **so that** the project is fully polished and well-documented for the final presentation.

### **9. Next Steps**
The project is ready to move into the design and architecture phase. The handoff prompts are as follows:

* **UX Expert Prompt**: "Sally (UX Expert üé®), please use this completed PRD, focusing on the refined 'User Interface Design Goals' section, to create the detailed UI/UX Specification for the SmartLabel AI project. Your primary focus should be on creating wireframes for the 'Side-by-Side Comparison' view and the 'Crisis Simulator' view."
