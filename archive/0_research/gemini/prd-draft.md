Of course. Executing a winning hackathon project requires a clear vision, a solid plan, and the right tools. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you build and deploy the **Cognitive Process Optimization (CPO) Platform**, complete with a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD), a step-by-step deployment process, and the key assets you'll need.

-----

### **Part 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

This document outlines the vision, features, and scope for the CPO Platform, serving as the single source of truth for the project. [1, 2, 3]

\<br\>

**1. Introduction**

  * **1.1 Purpose:** This document defines the requirements for the "Cognitive Process Optimization (CPO) Platform," a solution for the Geekathon 2025 Smart Food Factories Challenge. The CPO Platform is a real-time dashboard powered by a suite of generative AI agents designed to optimize quality, yield, and maintenance in a poultry processing facility. [4]
  * **1.2 Intended Audience:** The primary audience includes the Geekathon 2025 judges, mentors from Grupo Lusiaves and BRAINR, and the development team.
  * **1.3 Scope:** The project's scope is to deliver a functional prototype that demonstrates the core capabilities of three distinct AI agents via a web-based dashboard. The solution will showcase a sophisticated application of generative AI beyond simple chat, directly addressing the "GenAI is not chatAI" theme by generating actionable insights and operational plans. [4]

**2. Goals and Business Objectives**

  * **Goal 1: Demonstrate Advanced GenAI Application:** Create a solution that uses generative AI to generate novel data (synthetic defects), simulations (failure modes), and optimized plans (yield optimization).
  * **Goal 2: Deliver Tangible Business Value:** Showcase quantifiable improvements in key industrial metrics: reducing product downgrades, maximizing profit-per-unit, and preventing unplanned downtime.
  * **Goal 3: Align with Sponsor Expertise:** Build a platform that complements BRAINR's MES by adding a layer of intelligence and solves concrete operational challenges for Grupo Lusiaves.

**3. User Personas and Stories**

  * **Persona 1: Ana, the Plant Manager**
      * **User Story:** As Ana, I want a single, real-time view of my production line's health (quality, yield, machine status) so I can make fast, data-driven decisions to meet my daily targets.
  * **Persona 2: Marco, the Quality Control Inspector**
      * **User Story:** As Marco, I need a system that can automatically flag rare or subtle product defects that are difficult to spot, so I can reduce the number of downgraded products and ensure customer satisfaction.
  * **Persona 3: Sofia, the Maintenance Engineer**
      * **User Story:** As Sofia, I want to move from reactive to predictive maintenance. I need a tool that not only alerts me to a potential failure but also helps diagnose the root cause, so I can schedule repairs efficiently and avoid costly line stoppages.

**4. Features and Functional Requirements**

| Feature | User Story | Functional Requirements | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPO Dashboard** | As Ana, I want a single view of my line's health... | - Display real-time status widgets for Quality, Yield, and Maintenance.\<br\>- Visualize key metrics (e.g., Defect Rate, Projected Profit, Machine Health).\<br\>- Show alerts and recommendations generated by the AI agents. | Must-Have |
| **Quality Agent** | As Marco, I need a system that can flag defects... | - **(F1.1)** Ingest images from a (mock) production line feed.\<br\>- **(F1.2)** Use a computer vision model to identify normal products vs. anomalous products.\<br\>- **(F1.3 - GenAI Core)** Use a generative model to create synthetic defect images to augment the training data, improving accuracy on rare defects. | Must-Have |
| **Yield Agent** | As Ana, I want to maximize profit... | - **(F2.1)** Ingest (mock) data on incoming flock characteristics and live market prices.\<br\>- **(F2.2 - GenAI Core)** Use a generative AI model (via Amazon Bedrock) to generate an optimal, profit-maximized production plan in real-time.\<br\>- **(F2.3)** Display the generated plan and the projected financial uplift on the dashboard. | Must-Have |
| **Maintenance Agent** | As Sofia, I want to predict and diagnose failures... | - **(F3.1)** Ingest (mock) time-series sensor data from a critical machine.\<br\>- **(F3.2 - GenAI Core)** When an anomaly is detected, use a generative AI model to simulate potential failure scenarios and generate a high-confidence diagnosis.\<br\>- **(F3.3)** Display the diagnosis and a recommended action on the dashboard. | Must-Have |

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

  * **Performance:** The dashboard must update in near real-time to reflect changes in the underlying data. API responses should be \<2 seconds.
  * **Usability:** The dashboard must be clean, intuitive, and clearly communicate the insights from the AI agents.
  * **Scalability:** The backend architecture must be serverless to handle variable loads without manual intervention.

**6. Assumptions and Out of Scope**

  * **Assumptions:**
      * We will receive limited or no real-time data during the hackathon. The solution is designed to be data-resilient and will rely on mock/simulated data for the demo.
      * The judges value a compelling, functional prototype over a polished, production-ready application.[5]
  * **Out of Scope for Hackathon:**
      * User authentication and multi-user support.
      * Historical data analysis and trend reporting.
      * Direct integration with physical factory hardware (PLCs, cameras).
      * Mobile responsiveness for the dashboard.
