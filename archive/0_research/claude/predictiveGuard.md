6. PredictiveGuard: Zero-Downtime Maintenance for Food Equipment
The Problem: Unplanned equipment downtime costs food manufacturers €50K per hour, F7i with 40% of maintenance costs from reactive repairs. Food Engineering +2
The Solution: IoT-enabled predictive maintenance using vibration analysis and ML models, with n8n automating maintenance scheduling and parts ordering. ZenduIT +2
Technical Framework:
Vibration/Temperature Sensors → AWS IoT Analytics
→ SageMaker (failure prediction) → Lambda (risk scoring)
→ n8n Automation → Maintenance scheduling + Parts ordering + Technician dispatch
n8n Workflow Patterns:

Predictive Maintenance Chain: Anomaly detection → Failure prediction (72h advance) → Maintenance window selection → Technician assignment → Parts pre-ordering AWS
Escalation Management: Critical prediction → Production planning alert → Backup equipment activation → Customer notification
Knowledge Capture: Maintenance completion → Technician notes → ML model update → Best practice documentation

Demo Highlights:

Show vibration pattern predicting failure in 72 hours
Demonstrate automated maintenance scheduling
Calculate €1.5M annual savings from prevented downtime

Quantified Benefits:

85% reduction in unplanned downtime Food Engineering
40% decrease in maintenance costs
25% extension in equipment lifespan
