3. EnergyFlow Factory: Real-time Energy Optimization for Food Production
The Problem: Food factories waste 20-30% of energy due to inefficient equipment scheduling and lack of real-time optimization, Choose Energy costing €250K annually per facility.
The Solution: Smart energy management system that monitors consumption patterns, predicts peak loads, and automatically adjusts equipment schedules using n8n workflows. infiniticube
Architecture Design:
Smart Meters + Production Sensors → AWS IoT Analytics
→ ML Load Prediction → DynamoDB (energy patterns)
→ n8n Workflow Engine → Equipment scheduling + Peak shaving + Renewable integration
n8n Automation Examples:

Peak Load Management: Consumption spike detected → Non-critical equipment pause → Staggered restart → Cost calculation
Renewable Integration: Solar forecast → Production schedule optimization → Battery storage management → Grid interaction
Predictive Maintenance: Energy anomaly → Equipment health check → Maintenance scheduling → Downtime prevention

Weekend Build Plan:

Setup IoT simulators for 50 factory equipment pieces
Create energy optimization algorithms in Lambda
Build n8n workflows for automated load balancing
Dashboard showing real-time savings

ROI Demonstration:

25% energy reduction (€62.5K annual savings)
15% increase in renewable energy utilization
Carbon footprint reduction of 500 tons CO2/year
