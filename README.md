## 🎯 Problem

Food manufacturers like **Grupo Lusiaves** (Portugal's largest agribusiness) face critical challenges when exporting to international markets:

- **🌍 Complex Regulations**: Each country has unique labeling requirements, certifications, and compliance standards
- **⏰ Time-Consuming Process**: Manual label creation takes weeks per market, delaying product launches
- **❌ Error-Prone Compliance**: Human errors in regulatory interpretation lead to costly rejections and recalls
- **🚨 Crisis Response Delays**: Food safety incidents require immediate label updates across all markets simultaneously
- **💰 High Operational Costs**: Legal consultations and regulatory expertise for each market create significant overhead

**Real Impact**: A single product launch across 4 markets (EU, Brazil, Angola, Macau) currently takes 8-12 weeks and costs $50,000+ in regulatory consulting alone.
